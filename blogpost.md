Will Your Next Medical Supplier Accept Your Insurance? The Data Might Have the Answer

Have you ever searched for a pharmacy or a medical equipment supplier only to find out they don’t accept your insurance plan? It’s a common frustration. But what if we could use data to predict which suppliers are more likely to accept assignment? For this project, I analyzed a public dataset from CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) to do just that.

What Does the Data Tell Us? Our Key Questions
o understand the landscape of medical suppliers, I focused on a few key questions:

Where are most suppliers located? As expected, the distribution is not uniform. The data shows a strong concentration of suppliers in high-population states like California, Texas, and Florida. This suggests that access to services is closely tied to major urban centers.
How many suppliers accept assignment? The most surprising discovery was the nearly perfect split: about 48% of suppliers accept assignment, while 52% do not. This means a patient's options can be cut in half from the start, highlighting a significant challenge in accessing care.
What are the most common specialties? The predominant category by a large margin is "Pharmacy." This indicates that many pharmacies are also the main points of contact for basic medical supplies.
Can We Predict the Future? A Machine Learning Model in Action
Using this information, I trained a machine learning model (a “Random Forest”) to predict whether a new supplier will accept assignment. The model achieved an accuracy of about 74%, proving it could identify complex patterns in the data.

To put it to the test, I created a hypothetical scenario: a new pharmacy, “PharmaHealth,” opens in Pharr, Texas. What would it likely do?

Model’s Prediction: The model predicted that “PharmaHealth” would most likely not accept assignment, with a 74% probability.
This isn’t a definitive verdict, but a data-driven insight that could help the new pharmacy make strategic decisions. It might even encourage them to consider the benefits of joining more networks to better serve their community.

Conclusion
Data analysis isn’t just about finding information; it’s about creating tools that can help us make better decisions. While this model is a first step, it demonstrates the potential of machine learning to make the complex world of healthcare more transparent and navigable.
